# 🌟 Graphics Processing and Conversion Project 🎨

This project is an example of creating a `.ppm` file using the C programming language and then automating the process of converting this file using Python. The project performs a basic graphic operation to create a `.ppm` file and then uses Python to convert it to the `.png` format for display.

## 📂 Project Files and Structure

The project includes the following files:

- `main.c`: This is a C program file. The program creates a file with the `.ppm` extension.

- `converter.py`: A Python script used to convert the created `.ppm` file to the `.png` format.

- `Makefile`: This Makefile simplifies the automatic compilation of the project and its processing steps.

## 🚀 Project Usage

Using the project is straightforward:

1. Store the project files in a directory.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

3. Compile and run the C program using the `make all` command. This will create a `.ppm` file.

4. Use the `make run_converter` command to convert and view the `.ppm` file in the `.png` format.

5. You can find the image in the `output.png` file.

## 💡 Suggestions and Improvements

To enhance and customize this project, consider the following suggestions:

- Create `.ppm` files with different colors or patterns.

- Convert the `.ppm` file to a different image format other than `.png`.

- Expand the project into a web application and display the image in a web browser.
